// DEFINE WHICH PINS ARE USED FOR LCC INTERFACE
//
// NOTE: The LCC interface supports both WiFi and a hardware CAN connection. By default
// only the WiFi interface is enabled. To enable the CAN interface set the RX and TX
// pin definitions below to valid pin numbers.
//

// This is the LCC node identifier for the DCC++ESP32 Command Station. It is
// recommended, but not required, to request your own ID range via:
// https://registry.openlcb.org/requestuniqueidrange
//
// The format below must start with 0x and have exactly 12 characters
// the first 10 will be the unique ID range and the last two the unique
// node ID in the range. Using 00 or 01 is recommended for the command station
// for easy identification in the JMRI LCC node list.
#define LCC_NODE_ID 0x050101013F00

// This is the ESP32 pin connected to the SN6565HVD23x/MCP2551 R (RX) pin.
// Recommended pin: 4, 16, 21.
// to disable the CAN interface set this to -1
#define LCC_CAN_RX_PIN -1

// This is the ESP32 pin connected to the SN6565HVD23x/MCP2551 D (TX) pin.
// Recommended pin: 5, 17, 22.
// to disable the CAN interface set this to -1
#define LCC_CAN_TX_PIN -1

// Uncomment the next line to allow the DCC++ESP32 Command Station to act as
// an LCC Hub via the WiFi interface. When this is not enabled the Command
// Station will attempt to locate a hub to connect to if the CAN interface
// is not enabled.
// #define LCC_ENABLE_GC_TCP_HUB true
